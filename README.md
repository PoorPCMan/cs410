# cs410
Homeworks for UMB CS410. 

I took this class with Kenneth Fletcher during the semester of Fall 2018.

Made solutions publicly available as a way for people to learn from my mistakes.

HW1[DONE/Grade: 90%]: Mostly simple, but I guess I should've used more simpler functions. I had points penalized for not following the homework's instructions and compiling with C++11.

HW2[DONE/Grade: ???]

HW3[INCOMPLETE/Grade: ???]

HW4[DONE/Grade: ???]

HW5[NOT-YET-ASSIGNED/Grade: ???]

HW6[NOT-YET-ASSIGNED/Grade: ???]

HW7[NOT-YET-ASSIGNED/Grade: ???]
